  						<h3>iRate Politics was created to change politics.</h3>
  						<h4>iRate Politics is the first 24/7 live barometer of politician approval.</h4>
  						
  						
  						<blockquote>
  						  <p>"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness."</p>
                <footer>Thomas Jefferson</footer>
  						</blockquote>

              <p>With these words we continue the world’s great experiment of democracy.  Inspired by the Declaration and the Constitution we at IRate encourage you to speak out and comment about our government and the elected leader who run it.</p>
              
              <p>The Framers of the Constitution believed that the Creator gave us eyes to see everything, ears to hear anything and a voice to speak what we feel in our hearts.  IratePolitcs.com encourages you to use that equal voice to speak up to make the world a better place.</p>
              
  						
              <blockquote>
                <p>"The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing."</p>

              </blockquote>
              
              <p>So Be Irate!  Speak up! And rate your politicians!</p>
